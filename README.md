# Beginner Python Exercises

A collection of beginner-friendly Python console programs.  
This repository documents my learning progress as I practice fundamental programming concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, functions, user input handling, and simple algorithms.

Each script is independent and can be executed directly from the terminal.

## 🛠️ Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Modular Programming:** Logic organized into functions (`def`) following the **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- **Error Handling:** Use of `try...except` blocks to manage common runtime errors (`ValueError`, `IndexError`) gracefully.
- **Data Structures:** Practical manipulation of `list`, `tuple`, and string methods.
- **File Handling & Portability:** Use of absolute paths (`os.path`) and cross-platform console clearing (`os` / `platform`).
- **User Interaction:** Menu-driven console interfaces for better usability.

## 📂 Included Projects

### 1. **Number Guessing Game**  
[`adivinar_numero.py`](adivinar_numero/adivinar_numero.py)  
A console game where the user attempts to guess a secret number. Includes difficulty levels, input validation, and attempt history.

### 2. **Simple Calculator**  
[`calculadora_simples.py`](calculadora/calculadora_simples.py)  
A basic calculator capable of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square-root operations.

### 3. **Unit Converter**  
[`conversor.py`](conversor/conversor.py)  
Converts:
- Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit ↔ Kelvin  
- Miles ↔ Kilometers  

### 4. **Word Guessing Game**  
[`jogo_palabras.py`](jogos/jogo_palabras.py)  
A word-guessing game (similar to Hangman). Loads words in Portuguese from an external text file if available (`palavras_pt.txt`).

### 5. **Grocery List Manager**  
[`lista_super.py`](lista_super/lista_super.py)  
An interactive program to add, remove, and list items in a shopping list.

### 6. **NIM Game**  
[`jogo_nim.py`](jogos/jogo_nim.py)
Nim is a combinatorial math game in which two players take turns removing objects from different piles. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object and can remove any number of objects, as long as they all come from the same pile.
